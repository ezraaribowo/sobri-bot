```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Commands not appearing**: Make sure you've registered commands and set the correct webhook URL
2. **Permission errors**: Ensure the bot has the required permissions in your Discord server
3. **KV storage errors**: Verify your KV namespace is properly configured in `wrangler.toml`

### Debugging

- Check Cloudflare Workers logs in the dashboard
- Use `npm run dev` for local development with hot reloading
- Verify environment variables are set correctly

## Migration from Node.js Version

If you're migrating from the Node.js version:

1. Your event data will need to be migrated to Cloudflare KV
2. Role configurations will be stored in KV instead of local files
3. The bot will be available 24/7 without server maintenance

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the Cloudflare Workers logs
2. Verify your Discord bot permissions
3. Ensure all environment variables are set correctly
